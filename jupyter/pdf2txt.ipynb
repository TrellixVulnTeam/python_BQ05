For the family \\nman who also happens to be an angler, \\nthis coastline is a haven. \\n\\nHunstanton Although on the East Coast, \\nHunstanton looks out across the famous \\nWash from a westerly aspect. Once re-\\nnowned for its prolific tope fishing, the area \\nis now relatively underfished, yet on the \\nright day can still produce catches of tope, \\nsmooth hound, dog fish and stingrays. \\n\\nThe best tope on record here is a \\n62y2 lb fish taken in 1964 by Guy Morton. \\nAs a rule, the largest tope are taken by \\nboat-fishing offshore, but the potential for \\nshore-caught fish still exists. Generally, \\nthe beaches produce eels and flatties, a l -\\nthough in recent years good numbers of \\nbass have shown when onshore winds \\ncreate a good surf. The immediate area \\naround the town also offers a plentiful \\n\\nbait supply, with lugworm and ragworm \\nbeing the easiest to collect but razor fish \\nand peeler crab are there for the finding. \\n\\nHolme next the Sea Now a National \\nTrust area, this offers only limited beach \\nfishing but offshore lies Thornham Hole, a \\ngood tope and skate mark. A tope of 70 lb \\nis said to have been taken here in 1956 but \\nwas not officially recorded. \\n\\nBrancaster beach offers dabs, flounders, \\nsoles and eels to visitors, who may actual-\\nly drive their cars to within a stone's \\nthrow of the sea. Around the harbour, \\nmuch visited by tourists, mullet, bass and \\nsea trout inhabit the various creeks and \\ninlets but are rarely fished for. Those w i l l -\\ning to put in the effort w i l l find that the \\nmullet can be tempted with float-fished \\nbread-paste or the tiny harbour ragworm, \\nand the sea trout which are commercially \\nnetted locally w i l l sometimes strike at a \\nspinner or worm bait. \\n\\nBurnham Overy is a delightful Uttle \\nNorfolk fishing village full of charm and \\ncharacter. Close by, the village of Burn-\\nham Thorpe has the distinction of being \\nthe birthplace of Lord Nelson. \\n\\nDown by Overy Staithe, which is much \\n\\n137 \\n\\n\\n\\nused by holiday-makers at weekends, there \\nis some swimming, good shrimping at low \\ntide and lugworm-digging. Anglers may \\nalso launch their own craft from the staithe. \\n\\nFlatties, bass, mullet and the occasional \\nlargish sea trout run through Burnham \\nharbour and up the creeks with the \\nflood tide. Local netsmen sometimes take \\nspecimen-sized sea trout in their nets but \\nit would take considerable effort to catch \\nthese on rod and Une. \\n\\nHolkham is also a popular fishing venue \\nwith many coarse anglers who fish the \\nlake by the hall (see Stillwaters - Day \\nTicket) as well as offering beach anglers \\nsome flatties, including soles when the \\ntide is up. At low tide there is good bait-\\ncollecting in the form of gathering cockles \\nand digging for lugworm. \\n\\nWells-Next-The-Sea was once famous for \\nits smuggling activities but now its quaint \\nnarrow streets are walked by tourists. The \\nmain shipping channel runs into Wells \\nand is used by fairly large vessels. \\nAlthough subject to fairly strong tidal \\nflows, it offers good potential for flatfish, \\neels, bass and sea trout. A visit at low tide \\nwould reveal the route of gullies and posi-\\ntions of sandbanks to locate a good spot-\\nto fish as the tide floods. \\n\\nStiffkey has the same name as the little \\nriver which flows through the town and \\nunder the A149 coast road. The river spills \\nits water into the estuary via a sluice gate \\nsouth of Blakeney Point. Sea trout and big \\nmullet are taken periodically in the creeks \\nand channels which f i l l with the flood \\ntide. There is good lugworm-digging \\nalong the salt marshes at low tide. \\n\\nMorston and Blakeney Although these \\ntowns are two miles apart, they can be \\nclassified as one entity as far as the angler \\nis concerned. This is because boats which \\nfish out of these spots actually share a per-\\nmanent anchorage in the deep section of \\nBlakeney harbour, known as Blakeney Pit, \\n\\nwhich is about the only deep water suit-\\nable for permanent mooring in the whole \\nharbour. Anglers who have booked to fish \\noffshore with local skippers are then fer-\\nried out by tender from Morston Quay. \\n\\nNewcomers to the area must beware of \\nthe tremendous fall and rise of the tides, \\nwhich affect entry to and exit from the \\nharbour at Blakeney. Local fishermen wil l \\ngive advice to those wishing to launch \\ntheir own boats - but extreme care must \\nbe taken. \\n\\nThe entire southern half of the harbour \\nis good lug-digging ground, and anyone \\nwho digs for lugworm would do well to \\nrespect the future availability of this excel-\\nlent bait by not taking immature worms. \\n\\nDeepsea boat-fishing out from Blakeney \\ntakes place from early Apri l until the \\nbeginning of October, the popular species \\nsought by anglers being thornback skate, \\nknown locally as 'roker'. These average \\naround 8 to f 0 lb but specimens high into \\ndouble figures are taken regularly. There is \\nalso the odd tope to 40 lb and always plen-\\nty of dabs, with some dogfish and good \\nmackerel in season. The skipper of the boat \\nusually supplies fresh bait in the way of \\nsandeels and lugworms, but for much of \\nthe summer the angler may catch his own \\nfresh bait by feathering for mackerel, one \\nof the supreme sea baits and very good eat-\\ning too. Within the Umits of Blakeney har-\\nbour sea trout, which show up over much \\nof the North Norfolk coastline, are occa-\\nsionally taken. \\n\\nFor weather details, contact Joe Reed, \\nWarden of Blakeney Point (Tel: 01263 \\n740480). Boat-fishing trips can be arrang-\\ned through Mike Taylor (Tel: 01263 \\n740998). From October onwards, many of \\nthe Blakeney skippers take their boats \\nround the coast to Great Yarmouth, where \\nthey spend the winter taking out fishing \\nparties bent on catching cod and whiting. \\nAt the end of March they return to \\nBlakeney and the whole yearly procedure \\nrepeats itself. \\n\\nThe local tackle shop is Stratton Long \\nMarine, Blakeney (Tel: 01263 740362), \\n\\n138 \\n\\n\\n\\nwhich w i l l furnish visitors with helpful \\nadvice and also arrange boat-fishing trips. \\n\\nFeathering in the vicinity of the \\nharbour mouth w i l l produce good num-\\nbers of mackerel from July to September \\nand in the harbour itself, dabs, flounders \\nand eels are taken on worm baits all the \\nyear round. \\n\\nCley represents the first 'real' beach from \\nHunstanton, as the area between is essen-\\ntially a salt marsh. A steep shingle and \\nsand beach offers deep water close in at all \\nstages of the tide, so it is ideal for anglers \\nof all abilities. \\n\\nA favourite local hotspot is opposite \\nthe wreck situated to the right of the gap. \\nHere, good bass are found, and at low tide \\nthe wreck is within casting distance. \\n\\nDuring summer, dabs, plaice, floun-\\nders, eels, as well as the odd sole and dog-\\nfish can make fishing interesting, with \\ngood catches of mackerel likely at high \\ntide on a hot, humid evening in July and \\nAugust. During December to March, cod-\\nling are caught, particularly after a period \\nof northerly winds. \\n\\nSalthouse is renowned for its fine beach \\nfishing, where good dabs, flounders and \\nsoles may be taken along with the occa-\\nsional bass during the summer months. \\nThe beach consists mostly of heavy shin-\\ngle and sandy areas only 50 yards out \\nfrom low tide mark. Expect codUng from \\nDecember onwards, on both flood and \\nebb tides. Fresh lugworms may be \\nobtained from several houses along the \\nmain coast road at Salthouse. \\n\\nKel l ing The beach here is similar to the \\none at Weybourne, but there are only \\ntwo access points from the coast road. \\nThe first is approximately half a mile, \\nWeybourne side, of Salthouse beach road, \\nwhich goes across Salthouse Marshes. \\nThe second is about 100 yards on the \\nSalthouse side of the police station. These \\nlanes are extremely rough, so cars should \\nbe driven carefully. \\n\\nSpecies to be expected are flatties dur-\\ning the summer months and, particularly, \\ngoodish soles at late evening on an ebbing \\ntide. A number of codling appear from \\nDecember onwards. \\n\\nWeyboume has a beach of shingle which \\nshelves steeply into deepish water. There \\nare sandy patches some 50 yards out \\nwhere soles are taken to the left of the gap, \\nopposite the wreck which becomes visible \\nat low tide. Tim Oswick took a superb bass \\nof 14 lb 8 oz here on squid in 1994. \\n\\nOther species to be expected are dabs, \\nflounders, cod, whiting, eels, etc. Skate, \\ntope, mackerel and bass are taken from \\nboats. Really good bass are often found \\naround the wreck. To the right of the gap \\nunder the cliffs, the bottom is rough but \\nmany cod gather over this type of ground \\nin the winter for the rich feed it harbours, \\nand fishing can be exceptional at times. \\n\\nThere is a little boat-fishing available \\nthrough local skippers but this is depen-\\ndent on the wind and tide conditions. Bait \\nis available from local diggers, and signs \\nare displayed outside their homes along \\nthe coast road. Almost the entire coast \\nroad from Weybourne to Cromer runs \\nclose to the sea, and fishing and picnic \\nspots abound. \\n\\nSome favourite fishing locations for all \\nthe previously mentioned species w i l l be \\nfound about one and a quarter miles \\nnorth of Sheringham by turning towards \\nthe coast at the bridge to Spallow Gap - a \\nnoted cod spot during the winter, which \\nfishes best at high tide. \\n\\nSheringham is a sizeable town, with the \\nmain street running down to the beach. \\nTo the north, the beach comprises large \\nshingle at high water, offering deep water \\nclose in, but the ebb tide soon reveals flat \\nsand. This is interspersed with gullies, \\nparticularly where the chalky areas show, \\nalthough casting into these often causes \\ntackle losses. To the south, rougher areas \\nof large stones and kelp can be found \\nwhich offer peeler crab in late spring \\n\\n139 \\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the weather is warm and settled. \\nDuring onshore winds in May and \\n\\nJune the bass fishing can be excellent with \\neels also evident. Flatfish can be caught \\nduring most times of the year, with good \\nfishing for codling from December \\nthrough until March. The bass can be \\ntaken at high or low water but the codling \\nprefer the high tides, especially big spring \\ntides. Visitors can call in at the local tackle \\nshop, Fiddy's Tackle (Tel: 01263 822098), \\nfor fresh bait and additional information. \\n\\nWest and East Runton These beaches \\noffer rocky ground interspersed with \\nsandy patches. Bass fishing can be excel-\\nlent during the summer months for those \\nwilling to risk tackle losses in the rocks. \\nThe sandy patches produce flatties during \\nthe summer and cod from December \\nonwards. Dinghies can be launched from \\nthe slope at West Runton, and offshore \\nfishing is good for skate, doggies and occa-\\nsional tope during the warmer months. \\n\\nCromer is an ideal base for the family \\nman who happens also to be an angler, \\nfor, added to the obvious attractions, \\nthere is an excellent golf course. There is \\neven some excellent freshwater fishing \\nclose by in the Sawmills Lake in the \\ngrounds of lovely Gunton Park, just five \\nmiles south of the town (see Stillwaters -\\nDay Ticket). \\n\\nCromer is wel l known for its fine, all-\\nyear-round sea fishing. One of the best \\nspots is usually the pier, which offers \\ngood mixed catches of flatties, eels, the \\noccasional bass and even the odd tope \\nduring the summer. In winter, excellent \\ncodling and whiting are had from \\nNovember until March. In recent years, \\nbass have become quite prominent as they \\nhave all around the Norfolk coastline and \\na big one amongst numerous schoolies \\ncan turn up from almost anywhere - even \\nthe pier. \\n\\nGood local baits are mussels, lug-\\nworms and squid heads. A l l these and \\nexpert advice may be obtained from \\n\\nMarine Sports of New Street (Tel: 01263 \\n513676). \\n\\nOverslrand-Trimingham The area be-\\ntween these villages also offers beaches \\nmainly of flat sand interspersed with \\nwooden groynes. Although the water is \\nquite shallow even at high tide, the fish-\\ning can be excellent. At Overstrand there \\nis a sewer pipe at the bottom of the main \\naccess point to the beach and in the imme-\\ndiate area some very fine bass weighing \\ninto double figures have been caught. The \\nbest times are around two hours before \\nhigh or low tide to slack water, and both \\npeeler crab and squid w i l l produce. The \\nlatter probably accounts for most of the \\nspecimens taken. \\n\\nThe access to Trimingham is via the \\nSandy Gulls caravan site, where a road \\nleads down the cliffs to the beach. There is \\nsome parking here but the area can \\nbecome crowded at peak times. Bass fish-\\ning during the spring and autumn can \\nprove exceptionally good, with prolific \\ncatches of codling from October until \\nApri l , from two hours before to two hours \\nafter high water. Some lugworm can be \\ndug during low water springs, although a \\n'bait pump' is sometimes more produc-\\ntive for individual worms. \\n\\nMundesley is another rather flat, sandy \\nbeach but some deeper gulhes show up at \\nlow tide. Flatfish, eels and bass are the \\nexpected summer species with both w h i -\\nting and codling appearing from October \\nto Apri l . Some of the finest sport here is to \\nbe had straight in front of the main access \\nslope which leads from the car park. Best \\nresults usually come from two hours \\nbefore and two hours after high water for \\nthe codling especially, but rough, low \\nwater seas w i l l produce the bass. L u g -\\nworm can be dug from the sand banks at \\nlow tide. \\n\\nBacton is similar to Mundesley in tliat it \\ntends to fish well in the summer for dabs, \\nflounders and odd soles, etc., with whiting \\n\\n140 \\n\\n\\n\\nand codling showing up from late October \\nonwards. However, it has a bonus in the \\nform of really excellent offshore boat-fish-\\ning marks within Bacton Bay. \\n\\nSkate, or rather thornback ray, to give \\nits correct name, are the prime target \\nspecies at Bacton, but smooth hounds, \\nspurdogs and tope are also taken here \\nduring the summer. Boats can be \\nlaunched from the slipway at Walcott. \\nThe feature of the beach and in fact all the \\nbeaches down to Winterton is their flat, \\nsandy nature over the initial 60 yards, \\ndropping into a wide gully with a sand-\\nbank shelving up around 200 yards out \\nfrom the low water mark. \\n\\nLong-range casting can therefore really \\npay off over the high tide mark, so the \\nbait is placed in the gully. Paradoxically, \\nthe ebb tide can also fish wel l , simply \\nbecause towards low water most \\nanglers can reach the gully, and a \\nfavourite period is three hours before to \\naround an hour after low water. \\n\\nWalcott Offshore fishing is excellent here, \\nwith easy access for small boats from the \\nslipway on the coast road. The species are \\nidentical to those at Bacton. Beach fishing \\nis also excellent, with flatfish all year \\nround, plus bass during the summer and \\ncodling from October to March. Because \\nthe sea comes up to the concrete wal l at \\nhigh tide, the three hours before and one \\nhour after low water are most favoured. \\n\\nHappisburgh The fishing is similar to that \\nat Walcott, and along the sandy beach to \\nthe right of the gap dabs and flounders are \\nthe usual customers to worm baits. Skate \\ncome inshore during the summer months \\nand are occasionally taken by long-casting \\nfrom the beach. From September onwards \\none can expect whiting and then numbers \\nof cod between October and January. \\nFishing is best at high water. \\n\\nLessingham and Eccles There is easy \\naccess to a long, sandy beach which fishes \\nall the year through for dabs, with codling \\n\\nfrom October onwards. The best pros-\\npects are over the high water period. \\n\\nSea Palling-Waxham is just a five-mile \\ndrive from Hickling Broad and Horsey \\nMere - . both excellent coarse fishing \\nvenues (see The Broads). For the sea-\\nangler, offshore fishing in this area is \\nexcellent for thornbacks, spurdog, the \\noccasional tope as well as flat fish, all dur-\\ning the summer months, with whiting \\nand codling during the autumn and w i n -\\nter. Small boats can be launched via the \\ngap in the sea wal l but rollers are neces-\\nsary for the haul over the beach. Shore \\nfishing is also consistent with eels, flatties \\nand bass during the warmer months. \\nNorth or north-west winds in December \\nand January invariably bring codling over \\nthe offshore bank into the deep gully \\nwhich runs parallel to the beach. Three \\nhours before to two hours after high water \\nis a prime time, although low water can \\nalso produce in calm conditions. Access to \\nthe beach at Waxham is through the small \\nlane behind Waxham church. \\n\\nHorsey It w i l l be found that this beach \\nfishes best for two hours before and after \\nhigh water. Skate were at one time plenti-\\nful from this beach and, although not as \\nprolific nowadays, the night angler still \\nhas a chance of contacting them during \\nperiods of thundery weather. Winter fish-\\ning is also good for cod, and catches of \\nflatties can be taken all year through. \\n\\nWinterton is a continuation of Horsey's \\nsandy beach. Good freshwater fishing is \\nonly three miles away at Martham Ferry \\non the tidal River Thurne. So a holidaying, \\nall-round angler could hardly choose a \\nbetter location. The beach here is quite flat \\nand sandy with numerous small gullies. \\nHowever, these are continually changing \\ndue to the strong tides, especially around \\nthe 'Point'. At the north end, the wooden \\ngroynes that have stretched down from \\nHorsey finish, and in the spring many \\ngood bass are caught from this location. A \\n\\n141 \\n\\n\\n\\nrough sea is favourite, with two hours \\nbefore arid one hour after high water being \\nthe ideal times. Crab and squid both pro-\\nduce, with numbers of fish falling to the \\nformer but those real specimens to the \\nlatter. In winter, flatfish and codUng are \\ncaught but often strong tides bring heavy \\nweed to spoil fishing. \\n\\nHemsby-Newport-Scratby There is \\naccess to the beach at each end of these \\nlocations, with a fair depth of water quite \\nclose in. High water favours the longer \\ncaster but low water allows the average \\ncaster to reach the best spots. Tides are \\nstrong here but the last three hours of \\nboth flood and ebb usually produce well . \\nFlatfish, eels and the occasional large bass \\nfeature in the spring to summer period, \\nwith good catches of cod taken through-\\nout December and January. The deepest \\nwater is at Scratby, where a 32 lb cod was \\ncaught by Ivan Smith in 1981. \\n\\nCaister-on-Sea has a fairly deep sand and \\nshingle beach, where a fast tide runs at \\ntimes. There are the usual flatfish from \\nApri l onwards and excellent whiting and \\ncod fishing from mid autumn to early \\nspring, especially at night. Caister is a \\npopular holiday resort and so the beaches \\nbecome congested during high summer. \\nThe best sport is usually found during the \\nlast three hours of the ebb and over low \\nwater. A huge grey mullet of 8 lb 6 oz was \\ntaken here by John James in 1979. \\n\\nGreat Yarmouth is the second largest sea-\\nside resort in Britain and it seems to \\nbecome busier each year, but there is \\ngenerally enough space even during the \\nholiday season for the ardent angler to \\ncatch a few fish. \\n\\nThe variety of fishing is spUt up some-\\nwhat, in as much as one may choose to fish \\nthe sandy beaches, the harbour and river, \\nthe piers, or boat-fish well offshore. The \\nBritannia and Wellington piers and the \\nJetty offer fishing all year through for flat \\n\\nfish, eels and the occasional bass, with \\nwhiting and cod particularly prolific dur-\\ning the autumn and winter months - the \\nadvantage being that fishing is good at \\nany state of the tide. \\n\\nThe North Beach offers deep water \\nclose in and is noted for cod during the \\nwinter, with access available from several \\npoints off Marine Parade. Strong tides and \\nweed can make fishing difficult but the \\nresults are often well worth the effort. \\n\\nFishing from the South Beach is also \\nexcellent, particularly during the last three \\nhours of the flood tide but responds best to \\nlong-range casting. The area in front of the \\nPleasure Beach is particularly productive. \\n\\nOffshore during the summer months, \\nskate, doggies, large dabs and tope are \\ntaken, but the fishing really comes into its \\nown from autumn to spring, when huge \\nbags of sizeable cod are regularly taken, \\nincluding many fish weighing high into \\ndouble figures. The biggest cod taken off \\n\\n142 \\n\\n\\n\\nshore was caught by Jim Patterson in 1979 \\nand weighed 38'/2 lb. \\n\\nThe best bait by far is fresh lugworm, \\nand these are generally supplied by the \\nskipper of the boat. Local tackle dealers \\nalso supply fresh bait and wi l l furnish vis-\\nitors with valuable information on local \\nfishing and the availability of boat-fishing. \\n\\nGreat Yarmouth tackle dealers are: \\nF. Pownall, Regent Road (Tel: 01493 \\n843873) and Dave Docwra, Salisbury Road \\n(Tel: 01493 843563). For boat-fishing trips \\noffshore contact John Temple (Tel: 01493 \\n858523). Additional information regard-\\ning weather and conditions offshore can \\nbe obtained from the Coastguard Station \\n(Tel: 01493 851338). \\n\\nGorleston-on-Sea As far as the fishing is \\nconcerned, it would be as well to class \\nGorleston in the same league as that of \\nGreat Yarmouth. The species are the same, \\nwith excellent flattie and eel fishing within \\nthe harbours. South of the harbour the \\nbeaches fish well for whiting and codling, \\nespecially towards the wreck which is \\nabout one mile down the beach. A large \\ncar park is adjacent to the harbour. \\n\\nLocal advice and fresh bait may be \\nobtained from Gorleston Tackle Centre, \\nPier Walk, Gorleston (Tel: 01493 662448). \\n\\nA massive 34 lb cod was caught two \\nmiles offshore here in 1973 by C y r i l Easy \\nof Northampton, but much larger speci-\\nmens have been taken by commercial \\nlong-liners. In recent years, bass have \\nstarted to appear in larger numbers. \\n\\nBoat trips can be arranged through \\nseveral local skippers, including \\nKevin Easterbrook, Dorina, (Tel: 01493 \\n665621) and Jeff Bishop, The Ellen Bee, \\n(Tel: 01493 664739). \\n\\nPakefield is one of the most popular and \\nproductive venues in the area and finding \\na free spot on a Saturday night during \\nOctober is rather frustrating. The sloping \\nbeach of shingle and sandy is easy to fish \\nand offers a fair depth of water reason-\\n\\nably close in. The flood tide is best for the \\nlast three hours for all species, but the \\nlong-casters favour the last three hours of \\nthe ebb so they can clear the sandbank. \\n\\nA fair bit of inshore trawling is evident, \\nwhich limits summer sport, but autumn \\nand winter sees excellent fishing for cod, \\nwhiting and dabs. The dab fishing in \\nJanuary is superb both in terms of quality \\nand quantity. Lug-tipped with a small \\npiece of sprat seems to tempt the larger \\nflatfish. \\n\\nAccess is available where the boats are \\npulled up on the beach, and fishing is \\ngood almost anywhere. A favourite spot \\nis at the back of the rifle range, which \\nunfortunately requires a fair walk over \\nrough ground. \\n\\nKessingland has much to offer the \\nangling-addicted family man. There is \\ngood fishing from the local beach in a fair \\ndepth of water for dabs, flounders and \\nsoles in summer and cod and whiting for \\nthe keen beach angler from October \\nonwards. Although involving a long \\nwalk, the area around the 'Point' is a par-\\nticular hotspot. A massive bass of 19 lb \\nwas taken by commercial fishermen here \\nin 1994. \\n\\nBenacre was highly popular with beach \\nanglers because the beach here shelves \\ndeeply, affording excellent winter fishing. \\nHowever, access is difficult, involving a \\nhike of over a mile from either Covehithe \\nto the south or Kessingland to the north. \\nThe whiting arrive early, usually in late \\nAugust, followed by large numbers of cod \\nduring October, including many double-\\nfigure fish. \\n\\nCovehithe The sand cliffs are constantly \\nbeing eroded by the sea which reaches \\ntheir base at high tide making fishing \\nimpossible at this time. More of the road \\nwhich provides access disappears each \\nyear so, whether you go to the left or \\nright, it is a fair walk to reach the beach. \\n\\n143 \\n\\n\\n\\nResults on the ebb tide are good, \\nalthough the inshore bank tends to favour \\nthe long-casters for whiting and cod. \\nDuring October through to December \\ncatches can be excellent, especially follow-\\ning a south-by-south-west gale. During \\nsummer, sole are caught here, especially \\nat night on or just over the bank, using lug \\nor ragworm bait. \\n\\nSouthwold Like Great Yarmouth and \\nLowestoft, Southwold has a harbour and \\noffers varied sea fishing, both in summer \\nand winter. In the harbour, likely catches \\nare those ultra-shy grey mullet which can \\nbe so frustrating to catch and numbers of \\ngoodish bass up to the 8 lb mark. The bass \\ngenerally fall to lure anglers and to those \\nwho present crab and worm baits on fair-\\nly light tackle in summer. Best locations \\nare from the north and south harbour \\nentrance piers, with the greatest number \\nof bass running close to the southern pier. \\n\\nThe beaches offer good cod and whit-\\ning during the winter and bass as well as \\nsome soles during the summer. A hotspot \\nfor soles is usually the groynes to the \\nnorth of the old pier, blown down in \\nstrong gales several years back. \\n\\nDinghy-owners may launch their own \\ncraft from the slipway close to the old pier \\nand in the harbour, but anglers are asked \\nto check on local tides and weather fore-\\ncasts before going offshore to fish. \\n\\nLocal tackle dealers sell fresh bait \\nand will give sound advice on the fishing \\nin and around Southwold. Southwold \\nAngling Centre, High Street, Southwold \\n(Tel: 01502 722085). \\n\\nFor boat-fishing trips, particularly \\ndeepwater wrecking trips for big cod, Ung \\nand even pollack, contact David Wright, \\nskipper of Prospector I (Tel: 01502 722411). \\n\\nWalberswick is situated a little south of \\nSouthwold harbour, and the fishing is \\nmuch the same as that of Southwold. \\nGood bass are taken periodically in sum-\\nmer on spinners and artificial rubber \\n\\nsandeels. At low tide, lugworms and har-\\nbour ragworm may be dug from the estu-\\nary by the Bailey Bridge (the footbridge \\nlinking Southwold and Walberswick). \\nAlthough shallow, the beach does offer \\ndabs and flounders for most of the year, \\nwith codling and whiting occasionally \\nclose in during the winter. \\n\\nDunwich Once the capital of East Anglia, \\nDunwich offers the angler some excellent \\ncod fishing from the local beach which is \\nshingle and shelves quite steeply into a \\nfair depth of water all along Dunwich Bay. \\n\\nThe top bait for the area is the lug-\\nworm, and it was on this bait in April 1973 \\nthat Finningham angler Derrick Dorling \\nsurprised everyone in the sea-angling \\nworld by producing from the beach here a \\nmammoth turbot weighing 28/2 lb. \\nDerrick hooked into the fish at 2.30 in the \\nmorning after a fruitless night and put his \\nname in the record book by landing the \\nbiggest shore-caught turbot of all time \\nand only IV* lb short of the British record. \\n\\nThis catch, creditable though it was, \\nshould not in any sense be considered a \\nlikely future occurrence. Although turbot \\nmay occasionally be taken from East \\nCoast beaches, they are nonetheless a \\ngreat rarity. Most people have to be con-\\ntent with the more usual mixed catches of \\nflatties in the form of soles, flounders, \\ndabs and plaice, with whiting and codling \\nfrom the beach from late September \\nonwards. \\n\\nMinsmere and Sizewell There are four \\nmiles of beach between Dunwich and \\nSizewell, known locally as Minsmere \\nHaven. Access is through the nature \\nreserve to the large car park at the end of \\nthe cliffs. Fishing during the summer can \\nbe particularly good for soles, with the \\noccasional bass to add interest. Although \\na fairly shallow beach, winter sees good \\nnumbers of whiting and codling, and \\nsport is good during the last three hours \\nof both the flood and ebb tides. Behind the \\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\n\\npower-station at Sizewell the warm water \\noutlet attracts large numbers of 'school' \\nbass. Unfortunately, heavy netting has \\ntaken its toll, but fair numbers of fish to \\n3 lb can still be taken. \\n\\nAldeburgh is one of the better fishing \\nlocations on the Suffolk coast. With its \\nsteeply shelving beach of coarse shingle \\nand deep water it offers a wide choice \\nof fishing. The best flattie fishing is \\ngenerally up towards Thorpeness, and for \\nwhiting and cod one should turn south \\ntowards the local hotspot of 'Dirty Wall ' . \\n\\nAccess here is now limited to a mile or \\nso from the martello tower by a fence \\nerected by the National Trust. However, \\nthis steep beach produces superb catches \\nvirtually all year round, with a few sur-\\nprise species always on the cards. \\n\\nLugworm and fish baits are usually \\nfavourite, and either flood or ebb tides can \\nproduce good sport. \\n\\nOrf ord Ness probably represents the very \\nbest in shore fishing along the entire \\nNorfolk and Suffolk coastline. A steep \\nshingle beach with very deep water with-\\nin easy casting distance. The tides are \\nexceptionally strong, so weights of at least \\n6 oz may be needed to hold effectively. \\nDuring summer, sole, bass, eels, dogfish, \\netc. are caught with worm, crab and fish \\nbaits. In winter, cod and whiting abound \\nin numbers, an there is a real chance of \\nhooking into a cod over that 20 lb mark. \\nMr Ellis of Diss landed a 43 lb conger here \\nin 1973, so you never quite know what the \\nnext bite may bring. \\n\\nThe beach extends for several miles but \\naccess is rather difficult. It was once possi-\\nble to drive from Aldeburgh with a four-\\nwheel drive vehicle but the National Trust \\nfence has stopped that. A boat from \\nOrford Quay is the usual way of reaching \\nthe narrow spit of land known as Orford \\nIsland either on your own or on an organ-\\nised trip. The latter does rather dictate the \\nfishing time, but Peter Weir runs an excel-\\n\\nlent ferrying service for anglers with his \\nvessel Regardless, which offers party trips \\n24 hours a day, seven days a week for the \\ngreater part of the year. Telephone 01394 \\n450637 for reservations and information. \\n\\nFishing at all points is likely to be pro-\\nductive, although the area by the light-\\nhouse and wooden tower seem to produce \\nthe best cod fishing on the ebb tide. \\n\\nShingle Street beach could hardly have \\nbeen better named. It shelves sharply into \\ndeep water and in the winter months \\nbecomes crowded with whiting and cod \\naddicts. There is a lapse until around mid \\nApr i l when thornback ray may be taken \\nby beach anglers. Favourite baits are cuts \\nfrom fresh herring or mackerel for thorn-\\nbacks and lugworm for just about every-\\nthing else. Peeler crab can be killing when \\navailable. \\n\\nApart from the usual flatties and odd \\nuseful soles, good numbers of bass are \\nfound, especially around the river mouth \\nat the north end of the beach. Crabs and \\nworm baits on medium to light tackle are \\nadvisable here. \\n\\nEast Lane is really a continuation of \\nShingle Street beach and stretches down \\nas far as the mouth of the River Deben, \\nwhere it is backed by the cliffs at \\nBawdsey. The beach is stony and shelves \\nsteeply into deepish water over a snaggy \\nseabed. The species here include dabs, \\nsoles, bass, whiting, cod and a few skate \\nin season. The approach to this beach is \\nfrom the Woodbridge to Bawdsey road, \\nturning right at the Star Inn. Bait and local \\ninformation on the area may be obtained \\nat Woodbridge from the Rod and Gun \\nShop (Tel: 01394 382377). \\n\\nBawdsey is an ideal area for codling, soles \\nand bass. Fishing in the estuary of the \\nRiver Deben is good for grey mullet and \\nbass, with the thought that one may be \\nlucky enough to hook into a sea trout. \\n\\nAnglers should beware of the consis-\\ntently heavy tide rip in the river mouth. \\n\\n145 \\n\\n\\n\\nFelixstowe The town sits between two \\nimportant river estuaries. The Deben, with \\nFelixstowe's ferry on its southern bank, \\nflows in from the north, and south of the \\ntown hes spacious Harwich harbour, \\nwhich drains the Suffolk Stour (see Suffolk \\nRivers) and the River Orwell. Angling \\nbetween these estuaries from the shingle \\nbeaches is often rewarding, with excellent \\nwhiting and cod from late September on-\\nwards, especially at night. \\n\\nIn summer, bass are likely, and there is \\nalways the chance of a double-figure fish. \\nThe former British record bass of 18 lb \\n2 oz was caught here way back in 1943 by \\nthe late F.C. Borley. The best bass in recent \\nyears is the 16 lb 5 oz beauty caught by \\nRoger Mortimer in 1986. Another British \\nrecord fish was taken from Felixstowe, \\nnamely the humble lumpsucker which, at \\na fat 14 lb 3 oz, was landed from the beach \\nby W.J. Burgess in 1970. Lump-suckers, \\nalong with other species such as plaice, \\ndoggies, turbot, garfish and sea trout are \\nall taken at various times from the estuary \\nand beaches around Felixstowe but \\nshould not be considered common catch-\\nes. Neither should the 90 lb conger eel \\nfound washed up on the local beach in \\nJanuary 1974 by two local anglers. \\n\\nThe pier fishing here really comes into \\nits own from late September onwards \\nwhen good whiting and the cod arrive. \\nThere is no night fishing allowed, and a \\nsmall charge is made to anglers. During \\nthe warmer months there are plaice, soles, \\neels and bass to be taken as well as the \\nproverbial dabs. Best baits are small rag \\nand lugworms. \\n\\nOffshore sport is excellent from Felix-\\nstowe and highly organised. Anglers may \\nexpect really good numbers of whiting \\nand big cod from late September until \\nApr i l . The two largest fish in past years \\nwere the 43 lb cod taken by T . Marsh in \\n1968 and one of 40 lb 2 oz by A . C . Ashong \\nin 1973. The general run of cod though is \\nfrom 3 to 10 lb. For the summer boat \\nangler there is just about every species \\n\\nimaginable, with dabs, flounders, eels, \\nplaice, skate and bass predominating, but \\nalmost anything can happen. \\n\\nIn recent years, specimen catches have \\nincluded a huge bass of 18/4 lb to the rod \\nof Mike Bradley in 1994. \\n\\nAdditional information about the area \\nmay be obtained from Castaway Tackle \\nand Bait (Tel: 01394 278316), which is near \\nthe Ordnance Hotel in Felixstowe. \\n\\nOffshore fishing trips by boat can be \\narranged through the shop and through \\nMarkham's Tackle of Woodbridge Road \\nin Ipswich (Tel: 01473 727841). There are \\nseveral charter-boat skippers working out \\nof Felixstowe, including Ron Bayley \\n(Tel: 01394 284888) and Robert Brinkley \\n(Tel: 01394 270853). Anglers may also \\nlaunch their own small craft from almost \\nany spot along the beach. \\n\\nSEA BAITS \\nObtaining fresh sea bait is not always \\neasy, especially during the cod season \\nfrom October to March, when lugworms, \\nwhich are considered 'the' bait by most \\nNorfolk and Suffolk anglers, are in such \\ngreat demand. \\n\\nHowever, there are other excellent \\nbaits which may be gathered without too \\nmuch difficulty, or purchased quite rea-\\nsonably from commercial fishermen and \\nfishmongers. These baits may be used all \\nthe year round and some w i l l be found in \\nthe list below, with hints on how to obtain \\nand use them. \\n\\nNatural Baits \\nCockles are small bivalve molluscs with a \\nmost distinctive 'fluted' shell of about one \\ninch across. They make excellent baits and \\nare found mostly in north-west Norfolk \\nalong muddy, sandy beaches, especially at \\nlow tide. Commercially packed, pickled \\ncockles may be used as a poor alternative. \\nCrabs - Soft and Peelers There' are \\nseveral species of small crabs found close \\n\\n146 \\n\\n\\n\\ninshore which, in their soft or peeling \\nstage as they shed their shell to grow a \\nlarger one, make really terrific baits. They \\nare .usually found in this vulnerable state \\nhiding from predators under boulders \\nand large stones in the rock-pools particu-\\nlarly at low tide. Cod, skate, doggies and \\nbass, etc. w i l l all avidly take a 'peeler' \\nor 'softy'. \\nHermit Crab The local name given to this \\nsmall crab which has made its home from \\nthe shell of a whelk, is a 'Jack'. They can \\nbe bought cheaply from the whelk fisher-\\nmen of North Norfolk. Jacks are a good \\nall-round bait and are particularly liked \\nby thornback skate. To extract Mr Hermit \\nfrom his shell without crushing him, hold \\na lighted match under the shell or chip its \\nrear end and tickle the tail. Either way, he \\nw i l l soon pop out. \\nHarbour Ragworm These small cousins \\nof the famous king ragworm are much \\npaler in colour, being almost white, and \\nrather thin for their length. They are \\nfound in the mud of estuaries and may be \\ndug quite easily at low tide. A l l the flatfish \\nw i l l accept these small worms, and so, \\ntoo, w i l l eels, bass and mullet, which are \\nparticularly fond of them. \\nLugworms are the largest burrowing \\nworms to be found along the Norfolk and \\nSuffolk coastline, and are without ques-\\ntion the most popular of sea baits. They \\nare dug at low tide from parts of most \\nmud and sand beaches, after their distinc-\\ntive 'worm casts' have been located. Lug \\ncan be kept for a few days if put into a \\nshallow tray containing moist peat, or laid \\non a sheet of clean, dry newspaper and \\nput into a cooler. \\n\\nLug is the one bait that most coastal \\ntackle dealers are likely to sell. \\nMussels are bivalve molluscs and per-\\nhaps one of the most neglected sea baits. \\nThey are abundant around the piles of all \\npiers and breakwaters, and can be gath-\\nered easily at low tide. Once the shell has \\nbeen prized open with a strong-bladed \\nknife, the mussel should be used whole \\n\\nand the hook inserted into the firm part of \\nthe 'foot'. Just about every swimming \\ncreature w i l l take this bait, including, \\nunfortunately, crabs. \\nSandeels, not to be confused with the com-\\nmon or conger eels, are a highly popular \\nbait with tope and skate fishermen, espe-\\ncially in the early part of the season. They \\ncan be netted from the estuaries or pur-\\nchased from professional fishermen and \\nare best fished whole and preferably as \\nfresh as possible on a large, single hook. \\nShrimps The lowly shrimp can at times \\nprove a useful bait, especially when the sea \\nis calm and it can be lightly fished on float \\ntackle at harbour entrances or around pier \\nstanchioi\\\\s, etc. Then, one may expect such \\nspecies as bass, garfish and mackerel, etc. \\nShrimps are easily gathered by net from the \\npools left in the estuaries or along sandy \\nbeaches at low tide. \\n\\nIf you catch shrimps surplus to bait \\nrequirements, you can always eat them. \\n\\nFish Baits \\nMackerel, especially if freshly caught while \\nout bait-fishing, is the tope bait par excel-\\nlence. It should be used whole or, for skate, \\ncut into large slices or chunks. Mackerel \\nwil l also attract other smaller species if used \\nin strip form and, like the shrimp, is excel-\\nlent eating if freshly killed and cooked. \\nHerring are seldom caught by anglers \\nand must be purchased either fresh or \\nfrozen from the fishmongers. They may \\nbe cast a long distance from the beach, \\neither whole or in slices while frozen, and \\nfor this reason they are an extremely pop-\\nular bait. Thin strips of herring make a \\ngood all-round sea bait for the East Coast. \\nSquid Although the squid is actually a \\nmollusc, it appears under the heading of \\nfish bait because it may be purchased \\nreadily from the fishmongers - and the \\nsmaller the better. The tiny ones are used \\nwhole, and with their flowing tentacles \\nmake a most desirable and deadly bait for \\nmost species of sea fish. Larger squid \\n\\n147 \\n\\n\\n\\nshould be cut into suitable strips. Squid is \\nan excellent cod bait and stays on the \\nhook well when long-casting. \\nSprats are also obtained from the fish-\\nmonger and, if used whole, account for \\nsome good-sized cod. They are particularly \\nsuitable for pier fishing when short casting, \\nbecause then the bait stays intact and attrac-\\ntive. Sprats can also be mounted on spin-\\nning tackle and used effectively around \\nharbour entrances for bass and mackerel. \\n\\nOther small sea f ish and even small, \\nsilver-coloured, freshwater fish like dace \\nand roach can be effectively used as sea \\nbaits. They work especially well if used \\nwhole - and can be made more attractive \\nif one injects pilchard or sardine oil into \\nthem. A hypodermic syringe can be pur-\\nchased from tackle shops and, if armed \\nwith several different fish oils, the angler \\nis able to turn the unlikeliest of baits into \\nsomething palatable. \\n\\nT H E T I D E S \\n\\nRivers \\nThe tides on Broadland rivers ebb and \\nflow twice in each lunar day of 24 hours \\n51 minutes. The flow, or rising, of the \\nwater is called the flood, and the reflux, or \\ndropping, the ebb. When the moon is in \\nthe first and third quarter, there is a smal-\\nler high tide than usual, known as the \\nneap-tide. On the full moon, the rise is \\ngreater and is called the spring-tide. On \\nthe Norfolk Broads and rivers the flood \\ncontinues for about five hours and the ebb \\nabout seven hours. \\n\\nThe tide runs at from half a mile to five \\nmiles per hour, according to the distance \\nfrom the sea. With a north-west wind, high \\ntides can be expected, and in winter they \\noften bring up the 'salts', or salt water. \\nOccasionally, on particularly high tides. \\n\\nthe water wi l l be found brackish far up the \\nThurne, as far as Ludham on the Ant, \\nCantley on the Yare, and St Olaves on the \\nWaveney. \\n\\nTides around the coast, moon stages \\nand barometer readings can be obtained \\ndaily fromthelocalpress. \\n\\nSea \\nSea-anglers should equip themselves with \\ntide-tables, which can usually be obtained \\nfrom tackle dealers and ships' stores. If \\nnone is available, however, consult one of \\nthe national daily newspapers, where \\nHigh Water at London Bridge (LB) is \\ngiven. From this, the approximate time of \\nhigh water around these coasts may be \\narrived at by consulting the following \\ntable: \\n\\nH i g h water at Hunstanton \\nWells-Next-The-Sea \\nCromer \\nGreat Yarmouth \\nLowestoft \\nSouthwold \\nAldeburgh \\nFelixstowe \\nH a r w i c h \\nWalton-On-The-Naze \\nClacton-on-Sea \\n\\nadd 4 hr 40 min to London Bridge time \\n5 hr 1 m i n \\n5 h r 5 m i n \\n\\ndeduct 4 hr 55 min from London Bridge time \\n4 hr 26 min \\n3 h r 4 8 m i n \\n3 hr 23 m i n \\n2 hr 18 m i n \\n2 hr 18 min \\n2 hr 15 m i n \\n2 hr 1 min \\n\\nIt is usual for Greenwich Mean Time to be quoted; in Summer Time add one hour. \\n\\n148 \\n\\n\\n\""
